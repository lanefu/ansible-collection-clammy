    debian.yml includes the exact logic needed to deploy frr 7+ with bionic. There very well could be a better and more specific way to address this issue, but bionic does not like debian_legacy due to the specific version definition contained within.

    FRR install fix on Ubuntu 18
    
    Prior to this commit installs were being bypassed because the download
    directory was never changed. This was removed and instead of checking
    the download dir we check to make sure the frr package is instaled.

    Make sure FRR is started
    
    Currently, there are times with reload that the service will lock up. If
    this happens we will now make sure that the FRR instance is started at all
    times. Also instead of ignoring failures we will check if the files
    exist before moving them.

    Keep connectivity after installing FRR on debian
    
    When installing the FRR package, something happens to cause the default
    routes to go away. In order to fix this, we simply need to run `netplan
    apply`. But this needs to be chained off of the package install. So the
    slightly goofy `shell` module for the package install and `netplan
    apply` is a tad hacky, but provides a specific pattern we're attempting
    to hit.

    OSPF changes

    and interfaces in OSPF.

    Adds Static Routes, Prefix Lists, Route Maps
    
    This is to allow for more routing options. Currently only OSPF and BGP
    were allowed and there were no Route Maps for either, this is to add
    thos features in to be used as needed.

    Reload support
    
    This modification is to install frr python tools to allow for reloading
    of frr instead of having to restart whenever a configuration change is
    made. I also changed a portion that would stop frr from reloading if the
    frr_router_id was not set.
